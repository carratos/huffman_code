# huffman_code
Building a Huffman Tree from user supplied data.
Requirements of HUFFMAN_CODE are to Implement a "little end up" heap inside an array. Use the heap to build a Huffman tree from user-supplied data. Since the Huffman tree itself is not almost perfect, it can't be implemented inside an array so it will have to use left and right subtree pointers; Do an Inorder and Preorder traversal of the Huffman tree to deduce the actual shape of the tree the algorithms have built.
